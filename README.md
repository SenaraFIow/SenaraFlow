## 🧠 Open Source Functions

SenaraFlow's AI logic is built on adaptive, real-time models. Below are core Python and JavaScript-style functions powering key modules in the extension:

### 1. 🌀 LiquidityFlow: Real-Time Monitoring

```python
def liquidity_flow(market_data):
    liquidity_ratio = market_data['tokenVolume'] / market_data['marketLiquidity']
    if liquidity_ratio < 0.1:
        return 'Alert: Low Liquidity Detected'
    else:
        return 'Liquidity Flow Stable'
```
#### Description:
Monitors a token's liquidity by comparing its trading volume to total market liquidity. A low ratio may indicate exit risk, slippage, or deceptive market behavior.

#### Use Cases:
- Scanning tokens before entry
- Spotting unstable liquidity environments
- Early alerts on low-exit conditions

### 2. 📡 SignalBoost: Market Signal Evaluation

```js
function signalBoost(signalData) {
  const signalStrength = signalData.signalValue * signalData.reliabilityFactor;
  const signalThreshold = 200;

  if (signalStrength > signalThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: Strong Market Signal Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Signal Weak';
  }
}
```
#### Description:
Evaluates signal strength by combining raw signal value with a credibility factor. Triggers early alerts on promising market moves.

#### Use Cases:
- Detecting early-stage token trends
- Filtering noise and false signals
- Spotting breakouts before they go mainstream

### 3. 🔮 DataStream: Machine Learning Liquidity Forecasting

```js
function dataStream(marketData) {
  const liquidityRiskFactor = marketData.totalVolume / marketData.marketLiquidity;
  const liquidityThreshold = 0.4;

  if (liquidityRiskFactor > liquidityThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: High Liquidity Risk Predicted';
  } else {
    return 'Liquidity Risk Low';
  }
}
```
#### Description:
Simulates a machine learning approach to forecast potential liquidity traps by analyzing volume-to-liquidity stress.

#### Use Cases:
- Anticipating exit slippage or liquidity crises
- Flagging over-inflated trading activity
- Avoiding manipulated assets

### 4. 🛡 FlowGuard: Predictive Risk Management

```python
def flow_guard(market_data):
    liquidity_factor = market_data['tokenVolume'] / market_data['totalLiquidity']
    risk_level = liquidity_factor * market_data['marketDepth']

    if risk_level > 0.5:
        return 'Alert: High Liquidity Risk'
    else:
        return 'Liquidity Management Stable'
```
#### Description:
Evaluates token risk by factoring in market depth — a key measure of whether liquidity can support large exits.

#### Use Cases:
- Testing real order book strength
- Spotting artificial volume without depth
- Identifying tokens open to manipulation

### 5. 🔁 DynamicSignals: Adaptive Signal Intelligence

```js
function dynamicSignals(signalData) {
  const reliabilityScore = signalData.reliabilityFactor * signalData.frequency;
  const threshold = 100;

  if (reliabilityScore > threshold) {
    return 'Alert: Significant Market Signal Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Signal Not Significant';
  }
}
```
#### Description:
Adapts to market conditions by learning from the frequency and accuracy of past signals. Improves precision and reduces alert fatigue.

#### Use Cases:
- Creating evolving signal profiles
- Fine-tuning alerts over time
- Balancing sensitivity vs. stability
